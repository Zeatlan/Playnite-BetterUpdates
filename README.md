# Playnite BetterUpdates Extension

Tired of this long list of notifications telling that each individual games has an update?

BetterUpdates will go through your notifications, update the games then editing their "Completion Status" to "Updated" (Or the one you want) so you can clearly see which games need an update.

The extension will also edit their version so you don't have the notifications anymore. (**It will not update the game itself !**)

## How to use

-   Launch Playnite and wait for all your notifications to load.
    **Before clicking the "Check Notifications" button, you will need to set a "Completion game name"!**
-   Create a new empty game with the name you want (Example: TestGame).
-   Go to the Extensions tab and "BetterUpdates".
-   Write down the name of your empty game in "Completion game name" (In this example we write "TestGame").
-   Give this game the completion status you want for your games who need an update. (In this example I will give him a new completion status named "need Update").
-   Save the settings. (**Don't click the button "Check Notifications" before saving the settings!**)
-   If you got a popup saying that game was found, everything is working fine.
-   Now you can click the "Check Notifications" button and see all your games getting updated.

You won't need to give a game name everytime. For now, you can just click the button everytime you want to update all your games.

All the games that need updates will get their completion status changed to the one your gave in the settings.
The "Note" of the games will be changed, giving you the current version you have before updating and the old completion status.
